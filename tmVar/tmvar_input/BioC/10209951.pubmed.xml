In contrast with the transforming LMP1 oncoprotein, LMP2A is expressed in lymphocytes of healthy EBV carriers and considered to maintain viral latency. Critical for these LMP2A functions are a transmembranous epitope recognized by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the N-terminal immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), blocking B-cell receptor signaling. To characterize ITAM and CTL motifs of LMP2A and to correlate them with C-terminal variants of LMP1 including the 30-bp deletion variant (LMP1delta), comparative sequence analysis was performed on 76 samples from patients with reactive and malignant lympho-proliferation (infectious mononucleosis, n=21; tonsillar hyperplasia, n=16, chronic lympho-proliferation, n = 9; Hodgkin's disease, n = 8; Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, n = 5; AIDS-related large-cell lymphoma, n=17). The CTL motif was conserved in all but 2 cases (C426--&gt;S). The ITAM motif was characterized by strictly conserved YXXL sequences in all cases, with a sequence polymorphism in between. The B95.8 prototype was found in 17% (13/76) of cases, while in 72% a variant with 3 point mutations (166796 C--&gt;A, 166805 C--&gt;A, 166810 C--&gt;T) was detected; 11% had 1 or 2 of these mutations in addition to G--&gt;A at 166793. In the C terminus of LMP1, a hypervariable region including LMP1delta was described in 61% of cases. There was no significant association of a particular LMP2A variant with either malignant phenotype or LMP1delta, demonstrating that the functional domains of LMP2A are conserved and that the sequence polymorphisms in LMP1 and LMP2A are independent.</text></passage></document></collection>
