AIM: To evaluate the association between immune escape-associated mutations and nucleoside/nucleotide analog resistance mutations. METHODS: In total, 19440 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, who underwent resistance testing at the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital between July 2007 and December 2017, were enrolled. As determined by sequence analysis, 6982 patients harbored a virus with resistance mutations and 12458 harbored a virus lacking resistance mutations. Phenotypic analyses were performed to evaluate HBsAg production, replication capacity, and drug-induced viral inhibition of patient-derived drug-resistant mutants with or without the coexistence of sA159V. RESULTS: The rate of immune escape-associated mutation was significantly higher in 9 of the 39 analyzed mutation sites in patients with resistance mutations than in patients without resistance mutations. In particular, these mutations were sQ101H/K/R, sS114A/L/T, sT118A/K/M/R/S/V, sP120A/L/Q/S/T, sT/I126A/N/P/S, sM133I/L/T, sC137W/Y, sG145A/R, and sA159G/V. Among these, sA159V was detected in 1.95% (136/6982) of patients with resistance mutations and 1.08% (134/12,458) of patients lacking resistance mutations (P &lt; 0.05). The coexistence of sA159V with lamivudine (LAM) and entecavir (ETV)-resistance mutations in the same viral genome was identified during follow-up in some patients with drug resistance. HBsAg production was significantly lower and the replication capacity was significantly higher, without a significant difference in LAM/ETV susceptibility, in sA159V-containing LAM/ETV-resistant mutants than in their sA159V-lacking counterparts. CONCLUSION: In summary, we observed a close link between the increase in certain immune escape-associated mutations and the development of resistance mutations. sA159V might increase the fitness of LAM/ETV-resistant mutants under environmental pressure in some cases.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|S||T</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="1348" length="3"/><text>S/T</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|I|126|A,N,P,S</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="1356" length="11"/><text>I126A/N/P/S</text></annotation></passage></document></collection>
