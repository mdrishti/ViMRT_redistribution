Genomic differences between subtypes give rise to sequence variations in the encoded proteins, including the HIV-1 protease. Because some amino acid polymorphisms occur at sites that have been associated with drug resistance in the B subtype, it is important to assess the effectiveness of protease inhibitors that have been developed against different subtypes. Here we report the enzymatic characterization of HIV-1 proteases with sequences found in drug-naive Ugandan adults. The A protease used in these studies differs in seven positions (I13V/E35D/M36I/R41K/R57K/H69K/L89M) in relation to the consensus B subtype protease. Another protease containing a subset of these amino acid polymorphisms (M36I/R41K/H69K/L89M), which are found in subtype C and other HIV subtypes, also was studied. Both proteases were found to have similar catalytic constants, k(cat), as the B subtype. The C subtype protease displayed lower K(m) values against two different substrates resulting in a higher (2.4-fold) catalytic efficiency than the B subtype protease. Indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir inhibit the A and C subtype proteases with 2.5-7-fold and 2-4.5-fold weaker K(i)s than the B subtype. When all factors are taken into consideration it is found that the C subtype protease has the highest vitality (4-11 higher than the B subtype) whereas the A subtype protease exhibits values ranging between 1.5 and 5. These results point to a higher biochemical fitness of the A and C proteases in the presence of existing inhibitors.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|I|13|V,E</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="792" length="6"/><text>I13V/E</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|M|36|I,R</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="949" length="6"/><text>M36I/R</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|R|41|K,R</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="807" length="6"/><text>R41K/R</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|H|69|K,L</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="959" length="6"/><text>H69K/L</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="Identifier">p|SUB|H|69|K,L</infon><infon key="type">ProteinMutation</infon><location offset="817" length="6"/><text>H69K/L</text></annotation></passage></document></collection>
